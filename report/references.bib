  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted human activities in a
              way never documented in modern history. The prevention policies and
              measures have abruptly changed well-established urban mobility
              patterns. In this context, we exploit different sources of urban
              mobility data to gain insights into the effects of restrictive
              policies on the daily mobility and exhaust emissions in pandemic
              and post-pandemic periods. Manhattan, the most densely populated
              borough in New York City, is chosen as the study area. We collect
              data generated by taxis, sharing bikes, and road detectors between
              2019 and 2021, and estimate exhaust emissions using the COPERT
              (Computer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport)
              model. A comparative analysis is conducted to identify important
              changes in urban mobility and emission patterns, with a particular
              focus on the lockdown period in 2020 and its counterparts in 2019
              and 2021. The results of the paper fuel the discussion on urban
              resilience and policy-making in a post pandemic world.},

  abstract = {Modern freight transportation relies on trucks delivering millions
              of packages daily. There is limited research on urban
              infrastructure service quality, particularly signalized
              intersections for truck traffic use. Trucks experiences different
              service levels due to their low maneuverability, acceleration and
              deceleration. As India's economy grows rapidly in turn, resulting
              high truck demand in turn requiring truck service quality
              examination. This study collects traffic, geometric and
              conglomerative data from five Indian cities with 30 signalized
              intersections and 105 approaches. Truck drivers' satisfaction is
              collected at city outskirts where truck traffic is significant.
              Truck Level of Service (TLOS) is modelled using variables which
              have statistically significant correlation with perceived
              satisfaction score using Spearman correlation analysis. Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) use these variables as inputs. It is a
              intermediate modelling approach to black box machine learning
              algorithms and simple statistical models; which has a strong
              capability of handling the non-linearity in the perceived scores.
              In this study, six parameters affect TLOS, while some manuals use
              V/C ratio or control delay only for LOS estimation. Final GAM-TLOS
              model shows high accuracy with 0.92 R2. GAM-TLOS scores for service
              classes A-F obtained by linear interpretation of Likert Scale is
              valuable tool for Planners and designers.},

  abstract = { Recent crash frequency studies have been based primarily on
              generalized linear models, in which a linear relationship is
              usually assumed between the logarithm of expected crash frequency
              and other explanatory variables. For some explanatory variables,
              such a linear assumption may be invalid. It is therefore worthwhile
              to investigate other forms of relationships. This paper introduces
              generalized additive models to model crash frequency. Generalized
              additive models use smooth functions of each explanatory variable
              and are very flexible in modeling nonlinear relationships. On the
              basis of an intersection crash frequency data set collected in
              Toronto, Canada, a negative binomial generalized additive model is
              compared with two negative binomial generalized linear models. The
              comparison results show that the negative binomial generalized
              additive model performs best for both the Akaike information
              criterion and the fitting and predicting performance. },
