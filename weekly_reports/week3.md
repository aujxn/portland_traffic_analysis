# Week 3 (1/19 - 1/25)

The goals for this week were:
- Do introductory analysis
- Identify outliers or issues with the data
- Come up with an action plan for the rest of the term

The first two points were addressed in this ![Jupyter Notebook](../notebooks/basic_analysis.ipynb). At the end of that notebook, we also mention to check out this [web application](https://aujxn.dev/traffic) (built with Dash) for more granular exploration of the hourly data. Hopefully it still works when you try it out...

For the action plan we are still coming up with our approach with the help of the instructors. Any ideas you have in response to this initial analysis are welcome!
